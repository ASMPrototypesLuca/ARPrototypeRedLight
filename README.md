# ARPrototypeRedLight
This prototype is created with Create ML and SwiftUI. This prototype can be used to detect red stoplights to alert the user of my application for danger.

In the folder names trainingdata is all data presented and sorted in three sections (training, Testing, Validation) that has been used to train the AR object models.

I added the documentation that includes the assignment of the workshop (Machine Learning) as well.

There are 2 models uploaded, version 1 is created at the workshop, version 2 was created after the workshop to improve the Detection model
